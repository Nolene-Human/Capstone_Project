## Welcome to my Capstone Project Documentation

I used my Bachelor of Software Engineering final paper to build on my cybersecurity skills and knowledge set out in CyBOK (Cybersecurity Body of Knowledge)  Networking, Cryptography and Software Security. By leveraging the CyBOK knowledgebase, I ensure my approach is rooted in the most up-to-date industry knowledge requirements. 

The knowledge not only equips me to address a wide range of cyber threats, but also add experience in the basic skills required.

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) principles are an essential component of this project, focusing specifically on the security of web applications. I followed the web security testing guide principles, addressing the most critical web application security risks and mitigate vulnerabilities effectively using various tools. 

By integrating OWASP principles with CyBOK, I want to build my knowledge and habit in proactively design, build and develop my environments and applications against common vulnerabilities.

I have captured my learnings and journey on each topic.
