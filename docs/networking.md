**Goal**

Secure Home network add webserver and finally, securely host my application following the Zero Trust model. I used this section to enchance my skills in Linux, get a bettter understanding on servers and network trafficking.

All steps/actions below was executed through self study and my first time doing any of them. The reason was that this is not part of my course curriculum but noticed that these are essential skills I need to master to be able to get into DevSecOps and Cybersecurity.  

**The Journey**

# Week 1

## Linux
- Hardware setup and Troubleshooting
    - DualBoot Windows with Ubuntu
        - ðŸ’¢ Windows di dnot allow dualboot (linux or windows) until Bitlocker Key was entered. Did not have this key. [Found the solution thanks to Tricknology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY0Iz0NpAoU)
       

## Webserver

- Installing and maintaining web server hardware and software **NGINX** + **Gunicorn**
- Troubleshooting network and server failures and resolving issues

/Optimizing server networks and web application firewall configuration
/Reviewing and performance-testing existing server systems and web products
/Hardening networks, hosts, web servers and applications
/Implementing web server controls and active defense mechanisms
/Using command-line utilities to test web servers and extract logs

#Week 2

##CyBOK
