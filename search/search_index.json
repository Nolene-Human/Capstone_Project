This document is recording the 'the test early and test often' methodology applied threat modeling, automated testing (Snyk), code review and pentesting techniques. The Journey Before Development Begins I created a threat model using Microsoft Thread Modeling Tool to identify the possible threats on a basic login function using a typical login form. The results identified an extensive list of threats that can be avoided during built and the basis of the metrics criteria.

I followed the Zero Trust model, deepened my understanding of the CyBOK Network Security principles through building a webserver and hosting my application on-prem. \ud83e\uddb9 This allowed me create a sandbox to test various case studies of a home business requirements. Application Layer Threats: Distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) attacks, HTTP floods, SQL injections, cross-site scripting, parameter tampering, and Slowloris attacks, Presentation Layer Threats: Phishing attacks, Session Layer Threats: Hijacking attacks, Transport Layer Threats: Reconnaissance and DoS attacks, Network Layer Threats: Man-in-the-middle attacks, Data-Link Layer Threats: Spoofing attacks, Physical Layer Threats: Sniffing attacks. The Journey Step 1: Install Linux Ubuntu Dual Boot Windows machine with Linux Ubuntu Hardware setup and Troubleshooting \ud83d\udca2 Windows initially did not allow dual-boot (or reboot Windows) until I entered the Bitlocker Key that I did not have. \ud83d\udcaa The solution was to enable SECURE BOOT again and run the following CLI command to find the key on the laptop. manage-bde -protectors <the drive usually c>: -get Finding the solution took a few videos, but I finally got Bitlocker fully disabled. It is worth noting that Bitlocker is Windows additional data encryption security feature and disabling this opens up the machine to attacks. However, as demonstrated by Andy Malone MVP in How to HACK Windows Bitlocker - MUST SEE! , it is not hard to find this key and the convenience of having it off is currently exceeding the security benefit.

However Nginx cannot process dynamic content like Apache. Because the application hosted on this server is written using Flask Gunicorn had to be included into the stack. sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx Default FANG.html Installing Gunicorn a Web Service Gateway Interface, this will act as my 'translater' between application and webserver. pip install gunicorn flask Create simple 'Hello from Fang\" flask application and save in var Tool Description Flask Web Application Framework SQLite3 Database Gunicorn Web Server Gateway Interface Nginx Proxy Server Cloudflare DNS Step 3: Port Forwarding Threat Category Cloudflare Tunnel Step 4: Improve Security Security Goals Identify common vulnerabilites of a SOHO Network and ways to prevent them.
